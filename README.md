I have used following components for doing the Automation testing:
- Selenium Web driver
- TestNG

For running this project you need to:
- Install Chrome driver and Gecko driver from [Selenium official website](https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/)
- Install TestNG in the IDE. For Eclipse IDE you can follow this [website](https://www.guru99.com/install-testng-in-eclipse.html)

After installation; Please replace the path to Chrome and Gecko drivers in DriverBase.java 
```
/CharlyEducationAssignment/src/main/java/driver/DriverBase.java
```
Here in the code, due to time constraints, I have taken some shortcuts which I would not if it is a real project.
