I have used following components for doing the Automation testing:
- Selenium Web driver
- TestNG
- [WebDriverManager](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager): I have used this since installing the specific drivers and giving the path to different drivers are very annoying. Especially in a scenario like this, it gets very difficult for the person to build and check the code. 

### Pre-requisites
You will need to install the latest Chrome version i.e. Chrome 78 since the code depends on that. 

### Structure of the code
I have tried to segregate the code as per my understanding. I have divided the main helper classes in Driver, PageObject, and Utilities.
